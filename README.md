Plotting code for  my thesis: Comparison of the Properties of Isolated Be Stars with X-ray and Gamma-Ray Binaries (2017/18).

Abstract:
This report delved into the fundamentals of stellar binaries in an attempt to better understand
the mechanics at work that produce the various frequencies of electromagnetic radiation
observed frequently from stellar binaries. The most efficient way to achieve this was by
comparison, through a review of previous literature and the addition of new qualitative
comparisons of the Hα line observed from the disk of Be stars. The Hα line was used as it is
the most present in the disk, additionally, through secondary measurements of the Hα one can
calculate the EW, FWHM and ΔV of the source, these are critical in understanding the
emissivity, speed and radius of the Be stars disk and as an extension the binary companions
relationship with it. With all this information combined, a comparison is made between
isolated Be stars with those in both X-ray and gamma-ray binaries.
